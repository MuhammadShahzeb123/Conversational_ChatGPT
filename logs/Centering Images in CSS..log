{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To center the images inside a div called "Image_Div", you can use the following CSS code:\n\n```css\n#Image_Div {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n```\n\nThis applies a flexbox layout to the "Image_Div" element and centers its child elements horizontally and vertically.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `text-align` property to center the images horizontally as follows:\n\n```css\n#Image_Div {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n```\n\nThis centers all inline-level content, which includes images.\n\nIf you\'re still having issues getting the images to center, it\'s possible that there may be other styling conflicting with your CSS. In that case, you may need to use more specific selectors or adjust the other styles on the page to achieve the desired centering effect.'}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To center images inside a div with the ID of "Image_Div", you can apply the following CSS:\n\n```css\n#Image_Div {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n```\n\nThis would use the CSS `flexbox` layout to center the child elements of the "Image_Div" container element by horizontally and vertically centering them. \n\nAnother approach to centering images within an element is to use the `text-align` property with a value of `center`, like so:\n\n```css\n#Image_Div {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n```\n\nThis would center all inline-level content, including images, within the "Image_Div" container element. \n\nIf neither of these solutions are working for you, there may be other factors or CSS rules impacting the layout of the images within the "Image_Div" element. In that case, you may need to adjust other styling rules or use more specific CSS selectors for the targeted images within the element.'}
