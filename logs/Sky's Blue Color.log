{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "The Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen gases, along with small amounts of other gases and particles. When sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles.\n\nHowever, blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why the sky appears blue in color."}
